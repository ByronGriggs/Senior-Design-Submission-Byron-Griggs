This version can handle the original 4 functions (connect, log, vibrate, time) and has support for multiple tags, though of course it was never tested with multiple tags and almost certainly doesn't work.

In order for me to say that this version is complete, it would need to have a scroll feature for things
such as the log and view connected tags. Since my next step is to increase the text size, it would be foolish
to implement this only to have to immediately overhaul it.
