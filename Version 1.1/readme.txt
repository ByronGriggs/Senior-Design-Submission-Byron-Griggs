I increased most of the text sizes by 1.
Text size 1. is 12 px tall
2. is 16 px tall
3. is 24 px tall.

I also added a scroll bar for the logging function, but I didn't do one for BLE manage and find device, since
I can't test those yet

Next I'm gonna try and convert the Core2 server code to the M5stick so I can finally start testing multi tag
